## Project Setup
1. Download the necessary ```JAR file``` containing all required classes ```(Bank, Customer, Account, etc.)``` from your previous labs - MyBank.
2. Create a new project named ```GUIdemo``` in NetBeans without a main class.
3. Add the downloaded ```JAR file``` to the project's libraries:
4. Right-click on the project
5. Select ```Properties > Libraries > Add JAR/Folder```.
6. Add the ```SWINGdemo.java``` file from this repository to the project.
7. Ensure you understand the code in the SWINGdemo.java file before proceeding.

Launch the project in the usual way.
You should see a window where you can select one of the bank's clients. Clicking the "Show" button should display information about the selected client.
Add another button - "Report", which should generate a report for the clients in the lower part of the window, similar to the one in Lab 8 (CustomerReport).

Ensure everything works as expected and demonstrate the functionality to your instructor.
